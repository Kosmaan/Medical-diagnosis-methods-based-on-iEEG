# Medical-diagnosis-methods-based-on-iEEG
This work focuses on the development and evaluation of methods for classifying iEEG signals to detect epileptic seizure episodes using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Various model architectures were implemented and compared, and their performance was evaluated based on their ability to distinguish between seizure and normal states. Additionally, the project lays the groundwork for future research directions, including the integration of semi-supervised learning and the use of transfer learning to improve model accuracy and applicability to diverse datasets.
